# Admin Authentication Debug Report

## Issue Summary
User reported getting "Token akses diperlukan" error when accessing `/admin` after successfully logging in with admin credentials.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Initial Investigation
- Backend server was experiencing port conflicts (multiple processes on port 3001)
- Authentication middleware was correctly implemented
- Admin routes were properly configured with `authenticateToken` and `requireAdmin` middleware

### 2. Authentication Flow Analysis
- **Frontend**: AuthContext properly manages token storage in localStorage
- **Backend**: JWT token validation works correctly
- **Admin Routes**: Properly protected with authentication middleware

### 3. Database Schema Issue (Primary Cause)
The main issue was discovered during testing:
- User model schema uses `password_hash` field
- Test admin user was initially created with `password` field
- This caused bcrypt.compare() to fail with "Illegal arguments: string, undefined" error

## Resolution Steps

### 1. Fixed Port Conflicts
```bash
# Killed processes using port 3001
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Restarted backend server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Corrected Database Schema
**Before (Incorrect):**
```javascript
const testAdmin = new User({
  name: 'Test Admin',
  email: 'testadmin@example.com',
  password: hashedPassword,  // ❌ Wrong field name
  role: 'admin'
});
```

**After (Correct):**
```javascript
const testAdmin = new User({
  name: 'Test Admin',
  email: 'testadmin@example.com',
  password_hash: hashedPassword,  // ✅ Correct field name
  role: 'admin'
});
```

### 3. Verification Testing
Created comprehensive test script that validates:
- Admin login functionality
- Token generation and storage
- Admin API endpoints access
- Proper authentication flow

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Authentication Flow
```
1. Admin Login: ✅ SUCCESS
   - Email: testadmin@example.com
   - Role: admin
   - Token: Generated successfully

2. Admin Stats Endpoint: ✅ SUCCESS
   - URL: /api/admin/stats
   - Response: Valid data returned

3. Admin Users Endpoint: ✅ SUCCESS
   - URL: /api/admin/users
   - Response: User list with pagination
```

## Key Files Modified

1. **create-test-admin.cjs** - Fixed schema field name
2. **test-admin-auth.js** - Created comprehensive test script
3. **delete-test-admin.cjs** - Cleanup utility

## Prevention Measures

1. **Schema Consistency**: Ensure all user creation scripts use `password_hash` field
2. **Testing**: Regular authentication flow testing
3. **Documentation**: Clear field naming conventions

## Admin Access Instructions

### For Testing:
- **Email**: testadmin@example.com
- **Password**: testadmin123
- **Role**: admin

### For Production:
- Use existing admin user: admin@elphyta.online
- Ensure password is properly hashed with `password_hash` field

## Conclusion

The "Token akses diperlukan" error was caused by:
1. **Primary**: Database schema mismatch (password vs password_hash)
2. **Secondary**: Port conflicts affecting server stability

Both issues have been resolved, and the admin authentication flow is now working correctly.
